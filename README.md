# Altmetric Technical Exercises

In this directory, you will find two exercises:

* 01-problem: a programming exercise with some source data and a README;
* 02-refactoring: a refactoring exercise involving some existing code in need
  of improvement with a passing test suite but details of a bug in a README.

There is no time limit and feel free to use any external libraries you wish
(though hopefully none of the exercises should require much beyond the core
libraries and any testing frameworks you might want to use).
